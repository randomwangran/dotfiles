# This script retrieves unread messages from your Reddit account using a JSON
# link.
#
# To use this script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
# `curl`, `jq`, `ttf-font-awesome`.
#
# To get your Reddit token:
# 1. Go to "https://www.reddit.com/prefs/feeds/"
# 2. Click "your inbox" > "unread messages" > "JSON" and copy the
# token in the navigation bar.
#
# NOTE: `polybar-reddit` can also be used outside of polybar by replacing the
# following line: echo -e "%{F#cb4b16} %{F-}$unread"
# by: echo " $unread"
#
# WARNING: in order to easily share this script without security risk, it is
# recommended to place the JSON part containing the sensitive information in a
# separate GPG file.

# Replace this path by yours.
