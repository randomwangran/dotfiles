# This script allows you to notify new incoming emails using an IMAP
# server like isync or offlineimap.
#
# Thus, a systemd unit (can also be a cron job) will synchronize your
# emails and polybar will query this script to know which emails have
# not been read.
#
# To use this script with the icon, make sure you have installed Font
# Awesome, available with the `ttf-font-awesome` package
#
# NOTE: `polybar-mail` can also be used outside of polybar by
# replacing the following line: echo -e "%{F#cb4b16} %{F-}$numfiles"
# by: echo " $numfiles"

# Replace the path below with yours.
