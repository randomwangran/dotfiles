# This script automatically synchronizes the RSS Feeds of newsboat which uses
# `notify-send` to display the number of new articles.
#
# To do this, set the `notify-program` variables in ~/.newsboat/config and don't
# forget to make a cron to automate the execution of this script.
#
# NOTE: `notify-send` needs access to the session bus and doesn't care about
# your $DISPLAY. That why, your cron won't works if `pam_systemd` doesn't do
# this yet. To be able to receive notifications from crontab, this script
# settings `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` instead.
